# TODO

- Use custom allocators in game too
- Import and draw textures
- BVH and octree for level triangles
- Non axis aligned colliders
- Import different geometries separately from a single .dae
- Import scenes/levels from .dae
- Don't use working directory to look for data files in Bakery

# Low priority/later
- More error handling/logging
- Daemon that detects data changes and rebuilds?
