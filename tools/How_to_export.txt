## SKINNED MESHES

Blender's Collada exporter sucks, there's a few things we have to do to export the thing and get all
relevant information:

* Make empty vertex groups for all non deforming bones in the mesh. Otherwise the exporter ignores
them for some things.

* Bones that don't move and whose parents don't move don't get an animation channel. Hence, if you
have a root bone for example that starts at a non-rest pose but doesn't move through the
animation, the exporter ignores it completely and all that branch of joints gets messed up. We have
to nudge it ever so slightly in some direction so it gets an animation channel and everything works.

* Don't use _ on names (I should fix this...)
