## TODO

# Next up?
- CHECK HANDEDNESS once and for all.
- Implement some persistent state with save/load (option to reset easily)
- Design how to link entities with 'components' (mesh to render, collider, etc.)
- Materials... bind textures/programs depending on mesh.
- Raycast against AABBs/sphere before colliders.
- BVH for entities
- Non axis aligned colliders
- Import scenes/levels from .dae? We already do geometry but should we import more things?

# Low priority/later
- Try to build in linux/with different render backend
- Organize headers better?
- More error handling/logging
