## TODO

# Next up?
- Use custom allocators in game too
- Import and draw textures
- BVH and octree for level triangles
- Non axis aligned colliders
- Decompose transform matrices at data-preprocess-time? For blending etc.
- Import scenes/levels from .dae
- Don't use working directory to look for data files in Bakery

# Low priority/later
- More error handling/logging
- Daemon that detects data changes and rebuilds?
