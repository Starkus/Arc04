## TODO

# Next up?
- Opaque handles to things from rendering device?
- Import and draw textures
- BVH and octree for level triangles
- Non axis aligned colliders
- Decompose transform matrices at data-preprocess-time? For blending etc.
- Import scenes/levels from .dae

# Low priority/later
- Try to build in linux/with different render backend
- Organize headers better?
- More error handling/logging
