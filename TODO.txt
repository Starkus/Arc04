## TODO

# Next up?
- Archetypes? Export/import entities as archetypes and be able to instance them in runtime.
- Profiling
- CHECK HANDEDNESS once and for all.
- Implement some persistent state with save/load (option to reset easily)
- Sort render calls by material/shader not to rebind everything for every call.
- Raycast against AABBs/sphere before colliders.
- BVH for entities
- Import scenes/levels from .dae? We already do geometry but should we import more things?

# Low priority/later
- Try to build in linux/with different render backend
- Organize headers better?
- More error handling/logging
